## Captain: Coordinates the crews actions and makes decisions about priorities

### Possible key skills: Intimidation, Persuasion

### Station: On deck, Crows nest

### Feature: Captains Insight
The Captain has a number of Insight dice equal to thier charisma. As an action they may grant one die to one of the groups manning a component on thier ship. For the next 10 ship combat rounds that group may spend the die to augment a d20 check involving using a component, after seeing the number on the die but before learning the result of the check from the DM. Captain's Insight dice refresh every long rest. The die type is 1d(Captains proficiency bonus * 2), i.e. a level 1 captain would grant a d4, a level 6 would be a d6, etc.

### Available actions: 
  
  * Issue order

    Issuing an order successfully allows the player to take direct control over an NPC controlled component for an action, using the NPC's skills, or take the equivelant of the 'help' action for a PC controlled component, provided the PC follows the order!

    | Mutinous | +5 to DC and Disadvantage | Crew willing to actively work against thier captain. Even after the threat to the ship is dealt with the crew and captain will have to deal with one another|

## Gunner: Loads, aims or fires siege weapons

### Possible Key Skills: Athletics, Tool(siege weapon), Vehicle{water}, Perception

### Station: Weapon component

### Available actions:

  * Load
  
    Every component has a number of 'load' actions that must be taken in order to be ready to fire. The crew member taking this action reduces the 'load actions required' count by 1, and for every 10 rolled on a Athletics(str) or Siege Weapon(str) check they will reduce the number of load actions pending by an additional 1.

    _The Brazen Hawk has a stone thrower requiring 4 load actions between shots. Jester declares his intent to load and rolls a 14 on his athletics, bringing the number down to 2 more actions. Krin also loads but only rolls a 4, bringing the load count to 1. On the next turn Jester rolls a 23, which would reduce the load action count by 3 but only 1 was needed! The weapon is ready to fire and the 2 extra 'loads' have no effect, poor jester_
  
  * Aim

    For most devices aiming requires more than simply pivotting your arms; the large and heavy nature of seige weapons typically requires levers and gears to properly aim them. For every 5 that the crew member rolls on a Perception(wisdom), Siege Weapons(wisdom) or Siege weapons(intellegence) check they can increase the effective size of one compartment by 1 for the purposes of thier next shot, making it more likely they will hit thier designated compartment. They may spread these increases among multiple compartments. If the weapon is aimed again before firing any previous aiming results are lost.
    
    _Krin aims the stone thrower at the poor merchant vessel, rolling a 17 on his Perception score. He decides to target the Deck component, hoping to damage the sail or mast, and increases its effective size from 2 to 5. Since the merchant vessel only has a size 4 cargo hold and size 2 (now effectively 5) deck whoever fires the stone thrower will have a 5/9 chance of hitting the deck instead of 2/6. Good work Krin!_

  * Fire!
  
    Timing and a keen eye are the most critical components to choosing when to fire the siege weapon. This action allows the performing crew member to attack their target provided their weapon is loaded and aimed. The attack roll is made with a Siege Weapon(dex), Siege Weapon(wis) Vehicle{Water}(dex) or Vehicle{Water}(wis) check. For every 5 which the check exceeds the AC of the target the firing crew member may choose to increase a compartment's effective size for this shot by 1. They can split these increases among multiple compartments.

    _The moment of truth is upon them and Jester takes the shot, launching the stone in a high arc. His roll of 17 easilly beats the merchants vessel's ac of 11, and lets him aim his shot a little more carefully. Choosing to target the deck he increases the final size of it to 6. Now the DM will roll a d10 and on a 1-4 the cargo hold will be struck, on a 5-10 it will be the deck. Afterwords Jester will have the pleasure of rolling damage and seeing what, if anything, broke on deck. Its a good day to be a pirate!_
