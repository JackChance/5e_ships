## Captain: Coordinates the crews actions and makes decisions about priorities

### Key skills: Intimidation, Persuasion

### Station: On deck, Crows nest

### Feature: Captains Insight
The Captain has a number of Insight dice equal to thier charisma. As an action they may grant one die to one of the groups manning a component on thier ship. For the next 10 ship combat rounds that group may spend the die to augment a d20 check involving using a component, after seeing the number on the die but before learning the result of the check from the DM. Captain's Insight dice refresh every long rest. The die type is 1d(Captains proficiency bonus * 2), i.e. a level 1 captain would grant a d4, a level 6 would be a d6, etc.

### Available actions: 
  
  * Issue order

    Issuing an order successfully allows the player to take direct control over an NPC controlled component for an action, using the NPC's skills, or take the equivelant of the 'help' action for a PC controlled component, provided the PC follows the order!

    | Type | DC  | Description  |
    |--|--|---|
    | Calm | 0 | No known threats to the ship|
    | Strained| 5| Distant threats like an approaching storm or enemy ships on the horizon|
    | Troubled| 10| Handling threat (avoiding reef, dodging rocks, fighting enemy ship)|
    | Hectic| 15| Handling multiple threats(Ship is boarded while trying to navigate narrow straight, handling a threat during a heavy storm)|
    | Nightmarish | 20 | Supernatural or nearly unthinkable conditions (Engaging in combat while circling a massive whirlpool)|
    | Absolute trust| Advantage | Crew has absolute faith in the captain and experience working under them, no hesitation in obeying orders|
    | Mistrust | +5 to DC | New crew or they have reason to doubt thier captains abilities|
    | Mutinous | +5 to DC and Disadvantage | Crew willing to actively work against thier captain. Even after the threat to the ship is dealt with the crew and captain will have to deal with one another|

## Gunner: Loads, aims or fires siege weapons

### Key Skills: Athletics, Tool(siege weapon), Vehicle{water}, Perception

### Station: Weapon component

### Available actions:

  * Load
  
    Every component has a number of 'load' actions that must be taken in order to be ready to fire. The crew member taking this action reduces the 'load actions required' count by 1, and for every 15 rolled on a Athletics(str) or Siege Weapon(str) check they will reduce the number of load actions pending by an additional 1. Being in a dedicated weapon's bay reduces the DC by 5.

    _The Brazen Hawk has a stone thrower requiring 4 load actions between shots, and is mounted in a weapon's bay. Jester declares his intent to load and rolls a 14 on his athletics, bringing the number down to 2 more actions. Krin also loads but only rolls a 4, bringing the load count to 1. On the next turn Jester rolls a 23, which would reduce the load action count by 3 but only 1 was needed! The weapon is ready to fire and the 2 extra 'loads' have no effect, poor Jester_
  
  * Aim

    For most devices aiming requires more than simply pivotting your waist; the large and heavy nature of seige weapons typically requires levers and gears to properly aim them. For every 5 that the crew member rolls on a Perception(wisdom), Siege Weapons(wisdom) or Siege weapons(intellegence) check they can increase the effective size of one compartment by 1 for the purposes of thier next shot, making it more likely they will hit thier designated compartment. They may spread these increases among multiple compartments. If the weapon is aimed again before firing any previous aiming results are lost.
    
    _Krin aims the stone thrower at the poor merchant vessel, rolling a 17 on his Perception score. He decides to target the Deck component, hoping to damage the sail or mast, and increases its effective size from 2 to 5. Since the merchant vessel only has a size 4 cargo hold and size 2 (now effectively 5) deck whoever fires the stone thrower will have a 5/9 chance of hitting the deck instead of 2/6. Good work Krin!_

  * Fire!
  
    Timing and a keen eye are the most critical components to choosing when to fire the siege weapon. This action allows the performing crew member to attack their target provided their weapon is loaded and aimed. The attack roll is made with a Siege Weapon(dex), Siege Weapon(wis) Vehicle{Water}(dex) or Vehicle{Water}(wis) check. For every 5 which the check exceeds the AC of the target the firing crew member may choose to increase a compartment's effective size for this shot by 1. They can split these increases among multiple compartments.

    _The moment of truth is upon them and Jester takes the shot, launching the stone in a high arc. His roll of 17 easilly beats the merchants vessel's ac of 11, and lets him aim his shot a little more carefully. Choosing to target the deck he increases the final size of it to 6. Now the DM will roll a d10 and on a 1-4 the cargo hold will be struck, on a 5-10 it will be the deck. Afterwords Jester will have the pleasure of rolling damage and seeing what, if anything, broke on deck. Its a good day to be a pirate!_

## Helm

### Key skills: Vehicle(water), Nature

### Station: Rowers bench, Rudder, Ships Wheel

### Available actions:

  *  Direct ship
  
  The crew member may make a Vehicle{water}(wisdom), Vehicle{water}(intelligence) or Nature(wisdom) check to either close or increase the distance between their ship and another. The distance change is determined by the difference in the Speed of each ship (minimum 1). For every 5 the crew member rolls on thier check they may treat thier speed as 1 higher for this action.

  * Navigate Hazard

  Sometimes you have to sail through a dangerous area, sometimes you need to go where your pursuers wont. In either case the crew member at the Helm will need to make a Vehicle{water}(wisdom), VehicleP{water}(dexterity) or Nature(wisdom) check to safely navigate through. The DC depends on your ships size, the crowding conditions of the hazard and the current weather.

  * Ram

  Sometimes your best weapon is your ship. This follows all the same rules as 'Fire!' under gunner and can be combined with a Direct Ship action. The Ram action can only be performed if the distance between your ship and the target is 0 and uses Vehicle{water}(Dexterity) or  Vehicle{water}(Strength)



## Lookout

### Possible skills: Perception, Vehicle{water}, Nature

### Station: Crows Nest, Deck

### Available actions:

  * Keep watch

  This crew member's Passive Perception is the determining factor in detecting enemy ships. In addition it should determine the range at which they spot land and in detecting hidden hazards (reef, rocks, etc.). They may also use an action to Percieve for these, but that should be limited to situations where they have a good reason to be paying closer than normal attention.

  * Relay messages

  There are many methods of relaying messages, whether along the ship or between ships. They consist of visual, such as flags or flashed light patterns, audio such as whistle patterns or even magical. As a last resort the look out is at least typically situated best to shout over the noise of the ship. As an action the Lookout may use Vehicle{water}(Intelligence) or Vehicle{water}(wisdom) to convey a message. Use the Captain's command difficulty to determine how difficult it is to convey the message, adjusted for the method used.

  * Spotter

  By relaying information about how far off a shot lands a Lookout can help a Gunner zero in on thier target. Lookouts also play a valuable role in helping the Helm navigate the ship. Even on open waters an experienced Lookout can find favorable wind channels or areas where the sea is more forgiving to guide the Helm through.

  For spotting for a gunner the Lookout may use an action to roll either Perception(wisdom) or Vehicle{water}(wisdom). If they achieve at least a 10 on this check they will grant Advantage to a single gunner's Aim task. For every 5 above 10 they achieve they may also increase the effective size of a compartment of the target ship by 1.

  For spotting for a Helm they may use an action to roll either Nature(intelligence) or Vehicle{water}(intelligence or wisdom). If they achieve at least a 10 on this check they will grant advantage to the Helm's next task. For every additional 10 they can also give the ship an effective +1 to its Speed rating.


## Deck Hand 

### Possible skills: Athletics, Vehicle{water}, Carpentry tools, Blacksmithing tools, Tinkering tools

### Station: Any

### Available actions:

  * Bail water

  If the Deck Hand is in a section that has flooding they may spend an action to roll an Athletics(strength) check to reduce the Flooding Level. For every 5 achieved on thier roll they reduce the Flooding Level by 1, spread evenly among all connected sections with leftover reduction applying to thier current section first. 
  
  The cantrip Shape Water can be used in various ways to aid this task. A caster may use thier action to either remove 3 Flooding Levels, prevent 3 Breaches from flooding for a round or split 3 between the two effects (seal 1 Breach for a round and remove 2 Flooding Levels)

  * Repair

  The Deck Hand may attempt to repair a damaged component or piece of equipment. There are 5 levels of broken; Undamaged, Damaged, Malfunctioning, Completely Busted and Utterly Destroyed. A check can only be attempted if the item is Completely Busted or less. The difficulty to repair is determined by the item being repaired itself, and typically it required Carpentry{intelligence} or Blacksmithing{intelligence} to fix, though complicated devices might require tinkering and magical ones may even require Arcana.

  * Patch Hull

  The Deck Hand may attempt to stem the flooding of a compartment by effecting hasty, ugly repairs. As an action the Deck Hand may make a Vehicle{water} check in a compartment with a Breach. The difficulty is 5+Flooding Level. The Deck Hand may close one breach if they match the difficulty plus another for every 10 above the difficulty.
