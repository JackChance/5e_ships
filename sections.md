Ships are collections of Sections, with built in Components and added on Equipment. Each Section is roughly 10'x10'x6' in size. Multiple sections of the same size can be grouped together to form a single large section, capable of housing larger components for instance. Doing so will make them more likely to be struck in combat however.
